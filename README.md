# Gerchberg-Saxton_algorithm_Deep_Unrolling_Network_for_Phase_Retrieval
A implementation of unrolling the iterative GS algorithm into an unrolled deep learning network. The GS iterative method interacts with deep learning process by intervals. The Fresnel Diffraction back-and-forth propagations in the network are implemented with LightPipes optical simulation on CPU. The deep learning layers in are Pytorch on GPU.
